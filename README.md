# Responsive Portfolio Website
---

I use this static website as my portfolio. It displays personal representation, links, and images. Elements arrange themselves nicely on all types of devices.


### How it's built
---

The website is built with HTML, Sass/CSS, Vanilla JS, and with no frameworks.

A lightweight particles-js library is used for particle animation in the background of the entire website.
